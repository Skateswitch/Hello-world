# Hello-world
I'm a newbie
I don't know what direction I want to head in. I think breaches are most interesting to me now but I'd also like to learn how to build programs and things of that nature. Honestly, I want to learn the whole 9 yards but I need to first become familiar with basic functions of the computer. I need to understand what it is I'm doing, what I want to do, and how to do it.
